# When to use Devin ?

>   Start your day by putting multiple Devins to work in parallel:

> Think through your TODOs, and carve out small tasks that a team of interns (Devins) can help with.
Return to draft PRs waiting for review around lunch.
  Tag Devin on Slack threads for quick fixes:

並行で走らせられるタスクならよさそう。


> Devin is great for tasks that take <30 minutes but often end up in large backlogs for weeks.
  Use the VSCode Extension for small refactors:

すぐに解決するものはSlack使うといいのか。

> The Devin VSCode Extension makes it easy to hand off work while you focus on your primary task.
Use Cmd+G to quickly share code snippets with Devin.
  Focus on easily verifiable tasks:

自分の作業と統合したい場合はVSCode拡張を使うとよさそう。

> Ideally, it’s as easy as checking that CI passes or testing an automatic deployment. Avoid ambiguous tasks where it can seem like the task was completed properly but something else is happening.
  Start small:

抽象度の高いタスクを任せるのは厳しそう。

> As you’re getting started, start many small runs to find the best use cases for Devin.
Try not to spend too many (>10) ACUs on one run. Devin’s performance degrades in long sessions.

まずは小さく始めて試行してみるのがよさそう。
